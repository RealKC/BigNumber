One day I was bored and decided to do this thing, I guess.

## Contributing

I'd like if you just opened an issue and pointed out the place where something could be changed for better optimization or something else, and then explained what I could do to make it better. I'd like to learn from this project and I feel like discussion in an issue would be better for me then just a pull request with code in it.
