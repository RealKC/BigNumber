One day I was bored and decided to do this thing, I guess.

## Contributing

I'd like if you just opened an issue and pointed out the place where something could be changed for better optimization or something else, and then explained what I could do to make it better. I'd like to learn from this project and I feel like discussion in an issue would be better for me then just a pull request with code in it.

## Can I use this in my project?

Often we ask ourselves "Can we?" when we should actually ask ourselves "Should we?", the answer to what you asked is indeed yes, however, as this was made to only be a learning project, I feel like it wouldn't be a good idea to use this in your project, be it personal, or not. I think if you need this kind of functionality, [the GNU MP bignum library](https://gmplib.org/)(licensed under LGPL) would be a better fit for you.
